# Epub Viewer [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/epub_viewer.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/epub_viewer)


originally a fork of [epub_kitty](https://github.com/451518849/epub_kitty) with few more features.
i made this out of epub_kitty because the author was inactive(he isn't merging PRs or attending to issues) and i started having alot of issues with the plugin

epub_viewer is an epub ebook reader that encapsulates the [folioreader](https://folioreader.github.io/FolioReaderKit/) framework.
